My most recent project was creating a python script that would take data from an excel spreadsheet and use a time series analysis algorithm: EWMA(Estimated Weight Moving Average) 

The sheet is capable of processing aprox 3000 rows of data in 30 seconds!, prior to this, it would take one week to process the data.
